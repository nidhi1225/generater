            <h5>Information Collection And Use</h5>
            <p>
            We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here.
            </p>

            <h5>Log Data</h5>
            <p>
            Like many site operators, we collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Site ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our Site that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages and other statistics. In addition, we use third party services such as Google Analytics that collect, monitor and analyze this.
            </p>

            <h5>Cookies</h5>
            <p>
            We may use cookies to store information for your convenience ("Settings"). We also may use third party advertisements on the Site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on the Site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Adsterra and Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).
            </p>


            <p>
            You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can greatly affect how you are able to interact with the Site as well as most other websites.
            </p>


            <p>
            Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information and report site usage statistics without personally identifying individual visitors to Google. This helps us to understand how visitors engage with the website. If you donâ€™t want Google Analytics to be used in your browser, you can install the Google Analytics browser add-on.
            </p>


            <p>

            <h5>Ad Service</h5>
            <p>
            We use Adsterra, and Google Adsense as our ad service providers.
            </p>

            <h5>Security</h5>
            <p>
            The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
